  ## [Description](#table-of-contents)

  This is a challenge to use SQL to create databases full of departments, employees, managers, and roles for a company as well as using Inquirer to produce prompts to view this company and make additions to its roster. This means adding (or subtracting) employees, roles, departments, and assigning managers.

  This challenge was created to demonstrate my skills with SQL, inquirer, and Javascript. This is to be completed for my Georgia Tech Coding bootcamp in respect for their curriculm in back end development.

  A user can use this challenge to view a companys database and see their departments, managers, employees, and roles within the company as well as some descriptory information such as salary. A user can also review this code to see how databases are constructed and how to use SQL sytax in javascript and inquirer prompts.

  ## [Installation](#table-of-contents)

  In order to install this application, you need to clone the code from my github repositry using a SSH key or HTTP. This can be done in your command line. Also you need to have SQL, inquirer, NPM, and console table installed to your local device to run it. These can be found in their respective documentation online.

  ## [Usage](#table-of-contents)

  In order to operate this application. You need to activate SQL by typing 'mysql -u root -p' in your command line. Once this is done, you can CREATE the comanp_db database and USE it using SQL commands. After that, you need to SOURCE your schema.sql and seeds.sql files using 'SOURCE db/schema.sql' and 'SOURCE db/seeds.sql'. Finally, you can operate the challenge by exiting the SQL by typing 'exit' and starting the application with 'npm start'.
